            <h2>Exploring Black Holes</h2>

            <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles, not even light—can escape from it. The gravitational pull is immense because the mass is squeezed into a tiny space. The boundary surrounding a black hole from which nothing can escape is called the event horizon. Once something crosses the event horizon, it is trapped and cannot exit the black hole.</p>
            <p>Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity. There are different types of black holes, including stellar black holes, which form from the remnants of massive stars, and supermassive black holes, which reside at the centers of galaxies and are millions to billions of times more massive than our Sun.</p>
            <p>Understanding black holes is crucial for astrophysics and cosmology. They provide insights into the nature of gravity, the evolution of stars, and the structure of galaxies. Scientists study black holes through observations of their gravitational effects on nearby objects and by detecting radiation emitted from matter falling into them.</p>
