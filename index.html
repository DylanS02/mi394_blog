                <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles, not even light—can escape from it. The gravitational pull is immense because the mass is squeezed into a tiny space. The boundary surrounding a black hole from which nothing can escape is called the event horizon. Once something crosses the event horizon, it is trapped and cannot exit the black hole.</p>
                <p>Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity. There are different types of black holes, including stellar black holes, which form from the remnants of massive stars, and supermassive black holes, which reside at the centers of galaxies and are millions to billions of times more massive than our Sun.</p>
                <p>Understanding black holes is crucial for astrophysics and cosmology. They provide insights into the nature of gravity, the evolution of stars, and the structure of galaxies. Scientists study black holes through observations of their gravitational effects on nearby objects and by detecting radiation emitted from matter falling into them.</p>

                <h2>Comparing Black Holes and Neutron Stars</h2>

                <p>Neutron stars are another fascinating cosmic phenomenon, differing significantly from black holes. They are the remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. Unlike black holes, neutron stars are incredibly dense objects composed almost entirely of neutrons. The gravitational pull near the surface of a neutron star is immense, but it is not strong enough to prevent light from escaping.</p>
                <p>Neutron stars can have diameters of only about 10-20 kilometers, yet they contain more mass than the Sun. This extreme density results from the collapse of the star's core during a supernova, squeezing matter to densities not found in normal matter on Earth.</p>
                <p>Scientists study neutron stars to understand fundamental physics, including the behavior of matter under extreme conditions and the nature of nuclear forces. Neutron stars also emit radiation, including pulses of radio waves, which can be observed from Earth.</p>
                <p>While both neutron stars and black holes originate from massive star cores collapsing post-supernova, the critical difference lies in whether the collapse stops at the neutron star stage or proceeds to form a singularity and black hole. The specific mass of the progenitor star determines this outcome, with more massive stars more likely to produce black holes due to their greater gravitational collapse.</p>
